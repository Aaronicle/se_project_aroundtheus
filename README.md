### Overview

- Intro

**Intro**

This project is all about learning adaptive design so that your website will function well on different devices. This is mainly done with media queries and display grid. It is challenging and fun and hopefully I did it correctly

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

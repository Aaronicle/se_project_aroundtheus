**Intro**

The name of this is se_project_aroundtheus. This project is all about learning adaptive design so that your website will function well on different devices. This is mainly done with media queries and display grid. It is challenging and fun and hopefully I did it correctly. I found the biggest challenges were making sure all the spacing in between items in all screen sizes especially in the footer section. I used a template in figma to create and design the project around it, getting all the images from there as well. I downloaded the fonts off a websit if woff2 files and connected them through my css files. Here is the link to my github: https://github.com/Aaronicle/se_project_aroundtheus
